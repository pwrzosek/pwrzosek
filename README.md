#### About me
- I got interested in programming over 10 years ago when attending my first course in this topic (it was taught in PASCAL). I used to write simple bots to games - it was both fun and really good way to improve my programming skills. I was using Cheat Engine for reverse-engineering and Delphi PASCAL for writing windowed apps. Later I switched to primarily using C++.
- I have done a significant amount of numerics (for Bachelor's, Master's and PhD). It was primarily linear algebra and decomposition of large and sparse matrices - often running on HPC.
- I have some experience in data visualisation (with Mathematica, Matlab, Python, R). I can also do some basic ML stuff in Python (PyTorch).
- I was teaching Programming and Numerical Methods, Algebra (both semesters) and Complex Analysis at my university. 
- I mostly use C++, Julia, Mathematica and LaTeX (last one for PDFs with math notation). I know a bit of Python, Matlab, FORTRAN, PASCAL, R, Rust (probably not exhaustive list).
- I had a pleasure to work with fantastic people during my PhD studies. Together, we published 5 papers (I'm first author of 4 of them). There are also two more or less finished works I contributed to that may appear in the future.
