- Hi 👋
- I’m currently a PhD student is Physics.
- I’m interested in Condensed Matter Physics including Physics of Transition Metal Oxides (Mott Insulators, Magnetizm, High-Tc Superconductivity, Quasiparticles).
- My research requires a significant amount of programming e.g in Julia, C++, Mathematica or Python, and sometimes other languages (mainly to decompose large and sparse Hermitian matrices).
