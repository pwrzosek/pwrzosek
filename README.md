#### About me
- I like to code for fun and challenges.
- I used to write simple bots to games. It was over 10 yrs. ago. I started it as a "summer project" for myself after 2 semesters of programming classes at my Uni. I had a lot of fun with that and learned a lot in the process (basics of reverse engineering, assembly, etc.).
- I designed and implemented state-of-the-art algorithms for investigating quantum phenomena in strongly correlated systems (hard numerics for my PhD in Condensed Matter Physics). Some of these algorithms took advantage of well-known linear algebra concepts incl. procedures for decomposition of large sparse matrices. Others were my own creative and novel ideas.
- I strive for both simplicity and performance when coding. I like when the code I write is readable and easy to understand. I also believe that the best code is no code at all. (No bugs, and it runs in O(1)). Making sure that the code is minimal and does only what is absolutely necessary in optimized way is one of the things that make programming interesting to me.
- Languages / tools I use(d): C++, Julia, Mathematica, Python (incl. PyTorch), LaTeX, MatLab, FORTRAN, PASCAL, R (+ R Studio), Rust.
- List of publications available at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cjwK5yoAAAAJ&hl=pl&oi=ao) profile.
